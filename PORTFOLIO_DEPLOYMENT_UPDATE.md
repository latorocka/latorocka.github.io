# 🔄 Portfolio Deployment Update

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Old Portfolio Removed

**Problem**: The latorocka.github.io site was showing an old portfolio instead of your new React application.

### ✅ Actions Completed

1. **Removed Old Portfolio**: Deleted the conflicting `index.html` file that was serving the old static site
2. **Updated Workflow**: Modified GitHub Actions to properly build and deploy the React application
3. **Triggered Rebuild**: GitHub Pages is now processing your updated React portfolio
